3)     Attend safety lecture / Watch the lecture video. – It is at the end of the Safety DVD.

 

4)     First aid course - Emergency First Aid at Work.

 

5)     Training in moving an unconscious participant from the scanner. – can be arranged at a convenient time for all of you as a group.

 

 

The safety test is in a format of 25 questions where short written answers required. The pass mark is 85%. It is mainly based on the Local Rules of Operations, but the MHRA guidance and risk assessments provide valuable background information. Importantly, pay attention to pregnancy and audible noise levels in the MHRA guidelines. You can take the test whenever you are ready.

 


First aid course: Either by St John Ambulance or Red Cross.

Once you have completed these, you will be given a Probationary Authorised Person status.

 

Then you can sit as the second AP for scans and watch and learn the first 5 scans and carry on further scans yourself and be comfortable setting up a participant in the scanner etc. to be given a Full AP status. There is no urgency to become a full AP since you can scan with me or other Full APs once you’ve become a probationary AP.
